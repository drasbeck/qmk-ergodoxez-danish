# qmk-ergodox-ez-danish
My attempt(s) at a Danish layout on the ErgoDox-EZ Shine.

## How to use (the latest build)
TBD

## Layout
![keymap](./keymap.png)

## Todo
* Upload illustration of keymap.
* Describe usage of firmware.
* Describe files.
* PR keymap into official repo.
* Figure a gaming layer out (perhaps).
* Improvements, improvements, improvements.

## Links
* [This](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/8ae83b490eb3f8ebc696c9531dff49bdfecd26ed/docs/feature_rgblight.md) might be useful if lighting is ever a thing.
